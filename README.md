Class Warfare [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/50DKP/Class-Warfare.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/50DKP/Class-Warfare)
=============

Class Warfare is a Sourcemod plugin for TF2 that pits two classes against each other, for example pyro vs spy.
Classes are randomized every round, and can also be re-randomized during the round using `sm_classwarfare_change_interval <seconds>`, `sm_classwarfare_change [red class] [blue class]`, or `sm_classwarfare_vote`.

Help can easily be accessed by using `sm_classwarfare_help`.  This command also tells you what the current classes are.
